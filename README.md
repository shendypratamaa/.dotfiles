## Installation : 1

using this option, I assume you dont have config at all e.g : `~/.config/*` \
setup shell like `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc` | `~/.zshrc` | `~/.zprofile` \
or maybe already installed homebrew or neovim. move your `old_config` for backup, \
this scripts bellow will install `homebrew` and `neovim` sync with my `dotfiles` \
it means, install all package list from `brewfile` where I was set up before \
and `stow` my dotfiles config. and will install neovim build from source to with \
neovim version 0.7.2 .

**install.sh**

```git"
git clone https://github.com/shendypratamaa/.dotfiles.git && ~/.dotfiles/install.sh -go
```

**after installation sucessfully**

- **node** \
     `nvm install --lts && nvm use node`

- **zsh-plugins** \
     re-open terminal for install zsh-plugins,

_this installation take much time, based on your internet connection, keep chil_
<hr>

**uninstall.sh**

this script will uninstall configuration \
include all package from homebrew, \
clean uninstall homebrew from your machine \
remove symlink files or directory from homebrew and dotfiles config

```git"
~/.dotfiles/uninstall.sh -go
```

<hr>

## Installation : 2

using this option, you will get only my configure dotfiles \
I assume you already installed homebrew \
you will need `git` and GNU `stow`
